## Welcome to Whack an Android

This was a fun assignment based on the whack-a-mole game.

# The changes I made to the assignment were
1. Added a custom icon to click on
2. Added code to change the background to green for 1/4 second for a successful click on the icon
3. Added code to change the background to red for 1/4 second if you missed the icon and clicked on the background (or you were too slow)

## Why is this page so small and does not have a lot of information

This page is just a test. I created the page from an assignment that i recently completed.
